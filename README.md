# Simple-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch.
Here I have made my own Simple linear Regression Algorithm code from Scratch.

We have first created a regression data sets using sklearn make regression library
Then we have split our dataset into train and test part as we do 
Then we created a simple linear regression algorithim using Class in python.WE have included all the function as there are in linear regression 
  such as fit , predict , coefficient , intercept
Then we created a object for our class then call all the function one by one.

And we compare our model values with sklearn model. guess what..? we are able to find the exact same results ..
